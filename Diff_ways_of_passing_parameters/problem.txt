Write functions squareByValue, squareByRef, squareByPointer that find the square of an integer, in three different ways:

a)squareByValue should return the square of the number, passing the argument by value.

b)squareByRef should modify the variable in the input to its square, passing by reference.

c)squareByPointer should also modify the variable in the input to its square, but passing the argument by pointer.
