    Write a program named Lab16C that calculates the average of a group of test scores where the lowest score is dropped. It should use the following functions.
        void getScores should have 4 double reference parameters (one for each test score)
        getScores should do the following:

- ask the user for 4 test scores,
- store them in the reference parameters

    void calcAverage (4 double parameters) should do the following:

- call findLowest passing the test scores as parameters

- total the 4 scores and subtract the result returned by findLowest

- this will leave you with the total of 3 test scores, so divide the total by 3

- print the average with a label

    double findLowest (so it has 4 double parameters) should find and return the lowest of the 4 scores passed to it.

    In the main function

- call getScores sending 4 double variables as parameters

- call calcAverage sending those 4 double variables

Note about reference parameters: remember that with reference parameters, you will use the & in the top line of the function itself, but you will not use the & in the call to the function in main.
