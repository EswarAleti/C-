Question 5 [15pts]

Write a function to find the first 45 Amicable pairs of numbers (series A259180

on the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences). A pair of numbers

x

and

y

is called amicable if the

sum of the proper divisors of either one is equal to the other. For example, 220 and 284 is a pair of

amicable numbers. The divisors or 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110. The sum of all those

numbers is equal to 284. The divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, which add up to 220. A proper divisor

is one that divides the number without a remainder.
