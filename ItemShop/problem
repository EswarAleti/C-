In c++, i have a class that has a data member that is a vector of objects (vector<object> objects) and each object is composed of one integer value (int price) and one string value (string name). What would be my best approach to create a member function that searches the vector for a range of specific items? ex: i have $100 and i want to output the top 5 objects from the vector that i can afford with this $100.
