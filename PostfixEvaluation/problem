For this assignment, you are to write a program, which will calculate the results of Reverse Polish expressions that are provided by the user.

You must use a linked list to maintain the stack for this program.

You must handle the following situations (errors):
Too many operators (+ - / *)
Too many operands (doubles)
Division by zero

The program will take in a Polish expression that separates the operators and operands by a single space, and terminates the expression with an equals sign.

The program will continue to take and evaluate expressions until the user enters a zero (0) on a line by itself followed by a new line.

Your sample output should show the handling of all the error conditions as well as make use of all of the operators.

Sample IO: (note: formatting of output isnâ€™t a critical issue but proper input processing is essential)
Input Output
10 15 + = 25
10 15 - = -5
2.5 3.5 + = 6 (or 6.0)
10 0 / = Error: Division by zero
10 20 * / = Error: Too many operators
12 20 30 / = Error: Too many operands
-10 -30 - = 20
100 10 50 25 / * - -2 / = -40
