2.1 Activity 1: Advanced Arrays For this activity, you are required to provide files called act1.cpp as well as a makefile to compile and run it. In your file, act1.cpp, should have a skeleton of a main program as per normal which you will then fill it in as per the following. The objective of this activity is to demonstrate advanced array use, in terms of how to use declare and use them for programs. At the start of your program, you are going to need to declare a 4 by 4 element two dimensional array. That is, 4 dimensions by 4 dimensions for a total of 16 elements in the array. Your program needs to read in from a file, values.txt, where each line of the file will have a comma delimited list of integer values with 4 lines in total. Each value of each line should be placed into the array, with the line corresponding to the row index. The first value in the line goes into the first, index 0, column of the array. So the array is filled row by row, from left to right. Once furnished, you need to compute the following: • Row Totals: The sum of all elements per row • Column Totals: The sum of all elements per column • Array Average: The average of all elements in the array 2 The output format should be displayed as follows (with example values): Row Total 1: 4 Row Total 2: 4 Row Total 3: 4 Row Total 4: 4 Col Total 1: 4 Col Total 2: 4 Col Total 3: 4 Col Total 4: 4 Array Average: 1 You will have a maximum of 10 uploads for this task. Be sure to include a blank values.txt in your submission. The string, fstream and sstream libraries are recommended.
